Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, 
the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row,
and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid 
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, 
which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. 
For this one you have to type the number of the row, the column and the number. 
If you think the number you entered is wrong you can validate it by answering the question "Do you want to validate?", 
you can chage it by typing its coordinates and then 0. This will delete the number you have entered.
