# SUDOKU-GAME
This sudoku game follows the usual sudoku rules: "Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, 
the objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row,
and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids that compose the grid 
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, 
which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. "
With the only diffrence that you type the coordinates and the missing number:
"For this one you have to type the number of the row, the column and the number. 
If you think the number you entered is wrong you can validate it by answering the question "Do you want to validate?", 
you can chage it by typing its coordinates and then 0. This will delete the number you have entered."

So when you start the game the first thing you will see is the question "Are you familiar with the rules?"
If you type Y the game will continue, but if you type N you will see the rules mentioned above.
Then it will ask you which level you want to play. After you answer a sudoku will apper, this sudoku will be a well-mixed sudoku variant from one of the sudoku files.

Then you eneted the cooridinates and start to play. After every move you have the option to validate the move you have made by simply enetering Y/N.
